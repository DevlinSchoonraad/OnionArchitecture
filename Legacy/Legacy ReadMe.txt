This folder is for hosting projects using legacy architectures. An example of 
such a project would be one using the classic n-layer architecture. Move the 
UI layer into the UI project while keeping the entities, business logic, and 
data layer in one or more projects in this folder. Best practice would be to 
have any new development follow the Onion Architecture that this solution 
documents.
