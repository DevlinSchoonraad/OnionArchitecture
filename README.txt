Description
===========
This solution contains an implementation and Templify template of Jeffrey 
Palermo's Onion Architecture. The implementation closely reflects work done by 
Matt Hidinger on the topic.

Usage
=====
The project, sans the .pkg file in the root, can be used as-isif you wish. 
Readme files are provided for each layer of the onion. However, it is highly 
recommended that you download Templify and move the provided template, the 
.pkg file, to the templates folder. The location of that folder as of this 
writing is as follows:

%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Endjin\Templify\repo

Once you copy the template .pkg file into that location, you can right-click 
on any folder and choose Templify Here to create a new project using the Onion 
Architecture.
